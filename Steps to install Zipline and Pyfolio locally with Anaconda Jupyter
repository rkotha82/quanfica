Following are the steps to install popular Quantopian's packages Zipline and Pyfolio with Anaconda

Note: Do not miss out on any of the following steps, missing commands may cause the installation to fail.

Zipline:

Step1: Create a new anaconda environment from the directory where you will be working i.e. from your anaconda base directory

> conda create -n zipline_env python=3.5

Step2: Activate the new environment

> conda activate zipline_env

This will change to the new environment, then install zipline from quantopian

> conda install -c quantopian zipline

Zipline gets installed successfully, now install ipykernel 

> conda install -c anaconda ipykernel

Install the new environment in jupyter notebook

> python -m ipykernel install --user --name=zipline_env

Lastly, run below command to install win32 API 

> conda install -c anaconda pywin32

This will complete the installation of zipline locally and you would see the new kernel created in your jupyter notebook
