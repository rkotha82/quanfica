Note: Following steps were completed with Anaconda and ingesting quandl data helps you work with zipline algorithms 

Step1: Install quandl package using below command

> conda install -c anaconda quandl or conda install quandl

Now you can import quandl successfully, as below:

> import quandl

Step2: Assign quandl API key, to get an API key you need to sign up for a free quandl account

> quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'qN6gQSWBdLeW27Ks6bhK'

Please note that the key value was changed for the purpose of this demonstration

Ingest the default quandl bundle in anaconda command prompt, activate and change to the environment you had created for zipline

> zipline ingest -b quandl

This will download WIKI metadata, WIKI prices table from quandl. This also merges daily equity files.
